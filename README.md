# Ruby Conferences

[RubyConferences.org][r] is a simple list of Ruby conferences, published
collaboratively with the Ruby community. Updates are sometimes posted to
[@rubyconferences][t].

## Eligible Conferences

Focus is a goal of this project and as a result, only conferences that are
specifically for Ruby are listed. That means that if a conference covers Ruby,
but is not specifically for Rubyists, then it is left out.

A good rule of thumb for whether a conference should be included is if its name
includes either Ruby or Rails and how it describes itself. A conference that
describes itself as a "Conference on Web Development" might be an awesome event,
but it's probably not a Ruby conference.

## Contributing

The list of events is driven by the two files in the `_data` directory - if you
have an update for those things, just change the YAML and send a PR.
