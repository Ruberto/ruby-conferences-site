# Ruby Conferences

[RubyConferences.org][r] is a simple list of Ruby conferences, published
collaboratively with the Ruby community. Filtered event news is available in the
[feed][f] and [@rubyconferences][t].

## Eligible Conferences

Focus is a goal of this project and as a result, only conferences that are
specifically for Ruby are listed. That means that if a conference covers Ruby,
but is not specifically for Rubyists, then it is left out.

A good rule of thumb for whether a conference should be included is if its name
includes either Ruby or Rails and how it describes itself. A conference that
describes itself as a "Conference on Web Development" might be an awesome event,
but it's probably not a Ruby conference.

## Filtered Event News

In an effort to keep the news focused, only the following items are covered:

* Dates announced
* Call for Proposal life cycle
* Registration life cycle
* Conference videos posted

A brand new event would also be covered by a news item.

### Life Cycle News

Both an event's call for proposals and registration are life cycle news - they
have an announcement and a deadline. This type of news is covered by the
following items:

* An announcement
* A reminder a week before the deadline
* A reminder the day before the deadline

## Contributing

The list of events is driven by the two files in the `data` folder - if you
have an update for those things, just change the JSON and send a PR.

If you have news, please follow the conventions you see in the
`source/news/posts` folder including filename and title. No biggie if you're not
sure - this can be tweaked easily enough.
